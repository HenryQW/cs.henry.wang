### Bringing Healthcare Data to Life

My research focuses on population healthcare data.

The current project aims to provide an advanced visual analytics and visualization tool for population healthcare data that integrates heterogeneous data.

This research is funded by the grant EP/S010238/2 from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).

### CGVC Web Master

I rejuvenated the Computer Graphics & Visual Computing (CGVC) [conference website](https://cgvc.org.uk/) with a brand new design. Also serve as the web master for day-to-day maintenance.
