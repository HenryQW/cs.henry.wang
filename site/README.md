# About Me

Under the supervision of [Dr. Robert S. Laramee](http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csbob/), I'm a full-time research associate (and a part-time PhD candidate) in Data Visualisation of the DataVis Group, Computer Science, College of Science, Swansea University.

Worked at Data Science, Medical School, Swansea University as a full-time software engineer, I co-founded MedGate, a platform for Natural Language Programming of Healthcare Data, in which I'm still actively participating in the development as a core developer.

## Bringing Healthcare Data to Life

My research focuses on population healthcare data.

The current project aims to provide an advanced visual analytics and visualisation tool for population healthcare data that integrates heterogeneous data.
