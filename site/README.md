Under the supervision of [Dr. Robert S. Laramee](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszrsl/), I'm a full-time research associate (and a part-time PhD candidate) in Data Visualization of the DataVis Group, Computer Science, University of Nottingham.

Worked at Data Science, Medical School, Swansea University as a full-time software engineer, I co-founded MedGate, a platform for Natural Language Processing of Healthcare Data, in which I'm still actively participating in the development as a core developer.
