## Cartographic Treemaps for Visualization of Public Healthcare Data

<Paper>

::: slot concept

Tong et al. present a novel hybrid visual layout called a cartographic treemap. By combining the space-filling advantages of treemaps for the display of hierarchical, multivariate data together with geo-spatial information, cartographic treemaps allow exploration, analysis and comparison of complex healthcare data [^O]. The authors work with 2 domain experts in health science throughout the development of cartographic treemap.

::: slot implementation

Figure 1 shows an overview of a cartographic treemap visualizing data of multiple diagnosis collected by 209 clinical commissioning groups (CCG) in the UK. Each node represents a CCG, the size of the node is proportional to the population and the color represents the disease.

Interactive users options are provided to adjust node size, rate of geo-spatial error, screen-space occupance, change color schemes, zoom and pan.

The authors adhere to the definition of cartographic visualization by Cruz et al. [^Cruz] and the definition of geospatial treemap by Man et al. [^Man].

A standard UK map only uses 18% of the screen space, to improve the space efficiency, a region center point is calculated for each CCG and it's used as a starting point for the cartographic layout. The treemap layout is then calibrated and visualized. Overlap of nodes is avoided using the fast node overlap removal algorithm by Dwyer et al. [^D1][^D2]. Bederson et al. [^B] present the Strip treemap algorithm, which is used for ordering treemaps that represent CCGS.
