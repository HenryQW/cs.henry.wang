## A Comparison of Several Key Information Visualization Systems for Secondary Use of Electronic Health Record Content

<Paper>

::: slot concept

Roque et al. review six information visualization systems for exploring EHR data[^O].

   1. LifeLine [^LifeLine]
   1. LifeLine2 [^LifeLine2]
   1. Timelines [^Timelines]
   1. KNAVE2 [^KNAVE2]
   1. AsbruView [^AsbruView]
   1. CLEF [^CLEF]

The authors state that temporal visualization if the primary visual design type for assisting the user in exploring EHR data. There is also a focus on pre-processed EHR data, specifically numeric data such as lab tests, heart rate, and blood pressure.

::: slot classification

The authors follow the categorization of visual analytics approaches by Bertini and Lalanne [^BL]:

   1. Pure visualization (VIS)
   1. Computationally-enhanced visualization (V++)
   1. Visually enhanced mining (M++)
   1. Integrated visualization and mining (VM)

Based on the categorization, the authors derive their classification table of the six reviewed systems as follows:

</div>

The authors also compare the six EHR systems by their target user, goals and tasks.

:::

::: slot challenge

1. The rapid pace of changing in medicine and technology sectors is making it difficult for researchers to make use of EHR data.
1. There is a lack of a uniform identifier to integrate different EHR data sources. (a standardized terminology)
1. Existing research methods do not cope well with the rapid increase in data size. (scalability)

:::

::: slot unsolved

1. Tools are often developed without user feedback and evaluation under clinical settings.
1. Existing tools do not provide enough automation enhancements for visualizing EHR.
1. EHR contain missing and inconsistent data that require additional data processing to handle.
