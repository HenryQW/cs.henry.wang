## PhenoLines: Phenotype Comparison Visualizations for Disease Subtyping via Topic Models

<Paper>

::: slot concept

Figure 1 shows PhenoLines, a visual analysis tool for the interpretation of disease subtypes built by Glueck et al., it aims to support the comparison of phenotype prevalence within and across disease subtype topics [^PhenoLines]. Topic models enable the user to mine cross-sectional patient's comorbidity data from electronic health records(EHRs) via a machine learning approach called topic modeling.

Glueck et al. develop PhenoLines with domain experts with both a machine learning and medical background.

::: slot implementation

The authors interview medical experts together with machine learning experts as the first step to pre-process EHRs. Disease subtypes are characterized and validated during the stage. Topic models are then trained and refined. Visualization tasks are abstracted using Brehmer & Munzner’s Multi-Level Task Typology [^BMMTT].

Figure 1 shows an overview of PhenoStacks. Section A shows the setting panel for user options such as comparing, sorting, filtering and aggregating of data. Section B shows the detail panel with a summary table for all topics and a set of juxtaposed timeline charts. Section C shows the topics panel, each topic comes with a sunburst chart representing the semantic relationships between phenotypes, a scatterplot displaying correlations between summary measures, a measure of the temporal evolution of phenotype probabilities. Section C also contains a rank-ordered list summarizing the phenotypes with highest probability in each topic. Section D shows the search panel that supports the direct look-up of phenotype terms.

Glueck et al. review previous work on integrating interactive visualization with topic modeling such as TIARA [^TIARA], ParallelTopics [^ParallelTopics], Textflow [^Textflow]. To address scalability issues, HierarchicalTopics [^HierarchicalTopics], RoseRiver [^RoseRiver] and TopicPanorama [^TopicPanorama] provide approaches rely on both automated and semi-automated clustering of topics based on word similarity.

The Topic Browser [^TTB], Termite [^Termite] and LDAvis [^LDAvis] provide techniques on verifying model quality through visual comparisons.

Visualizations have also been developed to investigate data from longitudinal cohort studies, such as CAVA [^CAVA], COQUITO [^COQUITO] and CoCo [^CoCo].
