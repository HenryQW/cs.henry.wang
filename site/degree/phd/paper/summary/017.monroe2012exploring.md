## Exploring Point and Interval Event Patterns: Display Methods and Interactive Visual Query

<Paper>

::: slot concept

The two classic systems Lifelines and Lifelines2 [^LifeLine2] are being deployed in an increasing set of medical applications, from the user feedback, Lifelines only supports the visualization of a single patient, while Lifeline2 supports a cohort of patients, it lacks the ability to visualize interval-based events. Monroe et al. propose EventFlow [^O], which integrates interval-based event visualization for cohorts of patients into Lifelines, as an extension to support datasets that come with interval attributes, for example, the 3-month interval during which patients took a medication [^O].

During the verification stage, the authors work with a team of 7 researcher from The US Army Pharmacovigilance Center (PVC), and epidemiologists are able to discover anomalies in their dataset immediately.

Figure 1 shows an overview of EventFlow. The left panel shows user options for choosing dataset and applying alignment, filtering and merging functions to adjust the aggregated record display in the middle, below the user options the authors color code a set of glyphs to represent event types and attributes on the timelines shown on the right.

Figure 2 shows the display simplification functions to assist the user to identify overlaps between events. User options to adjust overlap intervals are shown in Figure 3.

Querying of events can be done via Overlap Query (Figure 4), Subsequence Query (Figure 5) and Advanced Query (Figure 6) modes.

EventFlow is a novel system built almost from scratch. The authors first review the approaches proposed in the survey of interactive visualization systems of EHR by Rind et al. [^Rind]. Aigner et al. introduce various techniques on visualizing different kinds of temporal data in their book [^Aigner] which inform the temporal visualization of EventFlow.

Temporal logic, refer to the logical representation of interval events is inspired by Allen et al. [^Allen].

Temporal querying techniques for exploring large dataset are adopted from the work of Jensen et al. [^TSQL] and Snodgrass [^TQUEL].
