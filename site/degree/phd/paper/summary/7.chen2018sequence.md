## Sequence Synopsis: Optimize Visual Summary of Temporal Event Data

<Paper>

::: slot concept

Chen et al. develop Sequence Synopsis, a visual analytics framework that enables interactive data exploration of event sequence data. Real world datasets such as EHRs, vehicle fault logs and software error logs, often come with noise such as missing values or irregular values. The proposed framework which is highly tolerant to noise, aims to provide concise yet comprehensive overviews of event sequence datasets, with reduced visual cutter to improve efficiency in event sequence analyses such as patient pathway analysis and predictive vehicle fault analysis.

Figure 1 shows an overview of Sequence Synopsis. Section A consists of sequence clusters summarized by the framework, clicking on each cluster will bring up the corresponding summary view. Section B shows a list of events in the selected cluster. Section C shows a circular visualization of event co-occurrence with a focus event as the center point. Section D shows options that allow users to set filtering conditions.

Chen et al. adopt a two-part representation, a generic method to summarize event sequences, the steps are shown in Figure 2.

In this method, patterns are extracted from the original data based on the sequence of events. Corrections are made by inserting or deleting events in order to reduce noise. The authors acknowledge that for this approach there is always a trade-off between reducing noise and balancing visualization readability and information completeness, they follow the minimum description length principle (MDL) to find an optimal point for pattern summarization. The MDL states that "the best model for a dataset results in a minimized description length of it"[^MDL], in this case each pattern is effectively a model. Using the MDL, Chen et al. are able to avoid both overfitting and underfitting models while maintaining the information loss to a minimum.

Chen et al. review existing implementations in event sequence visualization. A common approach is to place events along a horizontal time axis, such as Lifelines[^LifeLine], CloudLines[^CloudLines] and TimeSlice[^TimeSlice]. Despite revealing detailed information of each event, identifying temporal patterns in multiple event sequences can be challenging.

Frameworks proposed to tackle the aforementioned problem are reviewed in the paper.

LifeLines2[^LifeLine2] provides visualizations at different temporal granularities. EventFlow[^EventFlow], Trail Explorer[^TrailExplorer] and CoreFlow[^CoreFlow] visualize events in tree-like branching structures.

Outflow [^Outflow], CareFlow[^CareFlow] and DecisionFlow [^DecisionFlow] condense event sequences into transition graphs and use nodes to depict events at different stages, edges are used to link events in sequence.

(s|qu)eries[^(s|qu)eries], COQUITO[^COQUITO] and DecisionFlow [^DecisionFlow] provide an interface for interactive querying, where users are able to focus on a subset returned from their queries.

Chen et al. further review event sequence visualization systems with data mining techniques such as FP-Viz[^FP-Viz], Frequence[^Frequence] and ActiveTree[^ActiveTree].
