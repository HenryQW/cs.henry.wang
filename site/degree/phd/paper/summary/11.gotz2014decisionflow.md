## DecisionFlow: Visual analytics for high-dimensional temporal event sequence data

<Paper>

::: slot concept

DecisionFlow is a visual analysis technique designed to support the analysis of high-dimensional temporal event sequence data. Traditionally, the high-dimensionality of datasets forces users to pre-filter events or collapse multiple low-level events into high-level categories, thus unable to present the full-resolution of the visualization. DecisionFlow aims to address the issue by combining an incremental milestone-based data representation with on-demand statistical analysis and an exploratory ﬂow-based visualization technique.

Figure 1 shows the overview of DecisionFlow, section A allows users to define the query conditions, section B, C and D show the returned results. Each dot in section C depicts an event in the dataset, ordered by the temporal dimension.

A milestone can be set by selecting an event in section C, which then collapses all the directly connected events into a milestone as shown in Figure 1 E. Overlapping edges are highlighted with a black outline to illustrate the associations. Hovering over a milestone shows a tooltip with more detailed information.

The authors review related works on visual analytics of temporal event sequence data. They conclude that traditional research focus on visualizing a single record such as LifeLines[^LifeLines], Timelines[^Timelines], PlanningLines[^PlanningLines], Continuum[^Continuum], recent research shift the focus to the visualization of multiple records such as Visualizing Social Science Diary Data by Vrotsou, Ellegard, and Cooper[^Everyday], ActiviTree[^ActiviTree], Outflow[^Outflow] and LifeFlow[^LifeFlow].
