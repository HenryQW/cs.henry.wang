Innovative information visualization of electronic health record data: A systematic review

::: slot concept

Innovative InfoVis systems of EHR data plays an important role for knowledge discovery. West et al acknowledge that visualisation has the potential to discover insights deeply buried by EHR data of patient visits over time, with records of changing problems, medications, treatments, and responses related to evolving health status.

By conducting literature search over 891 papers, the authors selected 18 for final analysis, which include both mature systems such as LifeLines, LifeLines2, KNAVE, KNAVE II, VISTORS and EventFlow and immature systems or prototypes such as DICON and Outflow.

Techniques for visualising EHR data are also reviewed and discussed in this paper, focusing on solving problems brought by the complexity of data and the handling of temporal data.

::: slot classification

The authors retrieved 891 papers from various online sources by using several combinations of search terms. Papers were then screened and excluded from research based on the following criteria:

1. Not related to human EHR
1. Not related to visualisation systems
1. Duplication
1. No concrete implementation or suggestion of visualisation

::: slot challenge

1. Related to EHR data:
    - More data being visualised means less likely to spot patterns
    - Size and Complexity of data
    - Temporal data
    - The rectification of data, e.g. missing values, incorrect data, mixed data types

1. The healthcare provider community are reluctant to adopt innovative visualisation techniques:
    - Lack of trainings in using such systems

:::

::: slot unsolved

1. Design of Vis systems:
    - Learning curve has to be minimised
    - Interactive features are often less satisfactory when the amount of data being visualised increased
1. A consensus needs to be reached for understanding/interpretation of data among the users (my understanding of users: researchers, clinicians, patients and even policymakers)
