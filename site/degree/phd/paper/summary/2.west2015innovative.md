::: slot concept

Innovative information visualisation systems for EHR data play an important role for knowledge discovery. West et al acknowledge that visualisation has the potential to discover insights deeply buried in EHR data of patient visits over time, with records of changing conditions, medications, treatments, and responses related to evolving health status.

By conducting an initial literature search on 891 papers, the authors select 18 for final analysis, which include both mature systems such as LifeLines [^LifeLine], LifeLines2 [^LifeLine2], KNAVE [^KNAVE], KNAVE II [^KNAVE2] and VISITORS [^VISITORS] and immature systems or prototypes such as DICON [^DICON], Outflow [^Outflow] and the radial starburst by Joshi and Szolovits [^starburst].

Techniques for visualising EHR data are also reviewed and discussed in this paper, focusing on solving problems brought by the complexity of data and the handling of temporal data.

::: slot classification

The authors retrieve literatures from various online sources by using several combinations of search terms. The primary objective of this paper is to discover the prevalence of visualisation techniques in EHR data, therefore, literatures are screened and the results are classified based on the following categories:

1. EHR systems that are visualising real-time data, such as LifeLines and LifeLines2 , which use the horizontal axis to represent temporal data dimension with events on the vertical axis. Such systems often support visualisations of a single patient and a group of patients but in a separate view, and users can drill down into details for evaluation.
1. EHR systems that are visualising retrospective data, such as KNAVE, KNAVE II and VISITORS, have a slightly different approach towards the visualisations of multiple patients records. Data are often summarised and abstracted before being visualised. They enable the visualisations of temporal data from diverse records.
1. EHR systems that are visualising predetermined data.
    1. The radial starburst developed by Joshi and Szolovits uses machine learning to find cluster in huge dataset but it doesn't provide interactions such as filtering, selection or brushing.
    1. DICON also applies algorithms to original dataset for clustering, the primary visualisation rendered is a treemap with glyphs.
    1. Outflow firstly visualises patient records as a sequence of events, then it uses benchmarks (based on previous patients record or consensus reached by the healthcare industry) to make assumptions on the patient's disease progression.

::: slot challenge

The authors identify several challenges faced, mostly related to the EHR data. They think more data being visualised means it's less likely to spot patterns within. This is partially contributed by the size and complexity of EHR data, even through scaling and zooming it's still a challenge to discover insights in a large dataset.

Larger datasets also lead to the increase of missing values, incorrect data and mixed data types. Therefore, rectification is almost impossible.

Too many variables can lead to uncertainty and even distort temporal events, a consensus has to be formed among the researcher

The authors also believe that he healthcare provider community are reluctant to adopt innovative visualisation techniques, primarily due to Lack of training in using such systems.

::: slot unsolved

1. Design of Vis systems:
    - Learning curve has to be minimised
    - Interactive features are often less satisfactory when the amount of data being visualised increased
1. A consensus needs to be reached for understanding/interpretation of data among the users (my understanding of users: researchers, clinicians, patients and even policymakers)
