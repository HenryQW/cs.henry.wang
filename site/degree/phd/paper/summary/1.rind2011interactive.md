:::

::: slot concept

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of information visualization systems for exploring and querying EHRs, by evaluating their techniques, designs and effectiveness in knowledge discovery. The authors intend to identify potential research directions for researchers and designers of InfoVis EHR systems.

::: slot classification

<div class="even">
<p>
The authors mainly evaluated 14 InfoVis EHR systems by the following criteria:

1. Data type covered
    - categorical: nominal or ordinal
    - numerical: continuous or discrete
1. Multivariate support
    - End users often need to analyse more than one variable
1. Multi-Patient record support
    - Support for analysis of single patient or a cohort
1. User interaction support
    - Select: brush
    - Explore: zoom and pan
    - Reconfigure: reposition, sort and adjustment of axis/item
    - Encode: visual encoding
    - Abstract/Elaborate: show/hide details
    - Filter: filter by time
    - Connect: show related data

They also briefly reviewed 32 other EHR systems.

:::

::: slot challenge

1. Different tasks require different techniques, visualisations need to be tailor-made.
1. Increase amount and complexity in data.
1. Patients keep their own data and are interested in visualising them, however, existing tools are not open for individual use (patients want self-serve).

:::

::: slot unsolved

1. Transition from multiple patient analysis ot single patient analysis is not well studied.
1. Lack of advanced interaction.
1. Systematic errors in data are hard to identify and rectify.
