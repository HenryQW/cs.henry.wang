::: slot concept

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of information visualization systems for exploring and querying EHRs, by evaluating their techniques, designs and effectiveness in knowledge discovery. The authors intend to identify potential research directions for researchers and designers of Information Visualisation to support EHR systems.

::: slot classification

The authors mainly evaluated 14 Information Visualisation for EHR systems. Multi-Patient record support is the support for analysis of a single patient or a cohort of patients, the authors conclude that this has the largest impact on the system.

In single record support, four features are identified as key features:

   1. Events over Time, which visualises a series of events over time with their categories.
   1. Numerical Data over Time, which visualises multiple numerical variables over time. It is normally non-interactive.
   1. Heterogeneous Data on a Common Time Axis Combined is the combination of events and numerical data visualised using different visualisations and techniques.
   1. Snapshots of Patient State, which heavily relies on the use of glyphs and animations to encode multiple data variables.

The authors acknowledge that multiple record support is required to support quality control and clinical research. Comparing to single record, it provides less detailed visualisations on a single patient but is able to identify clusters and patterns within a cohort of patients. It is subdivided into four categories:

   1. Event Sequences, which is similar to Events over Time but with multiple record support. However fewer details are available as the trade-off.
   1. Expressive Temporal Queries, is used for querying records with user-defined queries such as time intervals or event sequences (e.g. heart attack followed by stroke).
   1. Patient Records on a Common Time Axis.
   1. Snapshots of Multivariate Patterns in Patient Cohorts, this is achieved through the use of animations to find clusters in the cohort.

The authors also classified the 14 systems by their supported interactive features.

They also briefly reviewed 32 other EHR systems in conjunction with 6 related surveys.

:::

::: slot challenge

1. Different tasks require different visualisation techniques. In most cases, visualisations need to be tailor-made for each disease.
1. Increase amount and complexity in data, this requires not only multiple visualisation techniques but also the combination of automated analysis techniques and visualisations.
1. Patients keep their own data and are interested in visualising them, however, existing tools are either not open for individual use (patients want self-serve) or too complicated that ofter overwhelm the casual users.

:::

::: slot unsolved

1. The transition from multiple patient analysis to single patient analysis is not well studied.
1. Most systems are missing advanced interactive visualisation features to support clinical tasks.
1. Large amount of data increases the difficulty in data management and knowledge discovery.
1. Systematic errors in data are hard to identify and rectify.
