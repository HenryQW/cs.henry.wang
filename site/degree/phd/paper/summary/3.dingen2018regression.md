## RegressionExplorer: Interactive Exploration of Logistic Regression Models with Subgroup Analysis

<Paper>

::: slot concept

This paper presents a visual analytics tool, RegressionExplorer, for the interactive exploration of logistic regression models in the field of Clinical Biostatistics. RegressionExplorer enables experts to explore patients in clinical data in order to formulate new hypotheses. This is achieved by allowing quick generation, evaluation and comparison of logistic models trained with clinical settings as shown in Figure 1.

::: slot implementation

The clinical settings used for training logistic models are discussed and chosen with domain experts. The process begins by selecting a statistically appropriate responder from a given population.

Univariate analysis is then conducted to identify covariates, which are fed into the training process, covariates are associated with the mediator, the confounder, the moderator and the responder as shown in Figure 2.

Multivariate analysis and diagnostics check the responder against all covariates for irregularities.

Domain experts then verify the model using the predicted outcomes from a selected subgroup of a population.
