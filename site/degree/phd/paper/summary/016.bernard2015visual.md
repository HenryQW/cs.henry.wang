## A Visual-Interactive System for Prostate Cancer Cohort Analysis

<Paper>

::: slot concept

This paper presents an interactive visualization system for analyzing cohorts of prostate cancer patients as shown in Figure 1 [^O]. Prostate cancer often progresses slowly, in many cases patient's (especially seniors) life quality is unaffected by the tumor. Bernard et al. collaborated with two prostate cancer experts and developed the system to help clinicians make accurate clinical decisions by balancing side effects and expected results of performing a surgery.

Figure 1 shows an overview of the proposed system that supports the visualization of a cohort of patients. Patient attributes such as results from diagnosis, clinical events and measurements, are visualized on the left and right side. The center view is the Patient View that visualizes the current patient cohort, different phases are color coded to help clinicians identify potential correlations between phases and attributes. At the bottom, a history function enables the user to revisit pervious cohorts.

Figure 2 shows the Patient View with sorting and filtering functions, the user is able to activate them by brushing on the patient list to focus on specific similarities and to obtain a fine-grained cohort.

The authors review the approaches proposed in the survey of interactive visualization systems of EHR by Rind et al. [^Rind]. The use of glyphs is inspired by Borgo et al. [^Glyph].

Overall user interface and interactive function designs are inspired by previous EHR systems such as LifeLine2 [^LifeLine2] and DICON [^DICON]. StratomeX [^StratomeX] is a statistical technique for identifying and refining meaningful patient cohorts, which is used by the authors to reveal relations between multiple datasets.
