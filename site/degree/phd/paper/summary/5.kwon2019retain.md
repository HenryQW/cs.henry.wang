::: slot concept

Kwon et al. build an interpretable and interactive visual analytics system, RetainVis shown in Figure 1, to visualize the results produced via deep learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on electronic medical records. Since the RNNs use a black-box approach (a hidden layer for propagation, see Figure 2.), it is difficult to tie the predictions to particular features used during training [^rnn], the primary objective of RetainVis is to help domain experts better understand why the predictions were produced.

RetainVis has 5 areas, illustrated by Figure 1.

**Area A** shows an overview of all patients:

- A scatter plot shows the risks of comorbidities of a chosen disease.
- The bar chart on the top left shows the top three contributors with their scores.
- Another bar chart, an area chart and a circle chart show the distribution of gender, age and predicted risks.

**Area B** shows a summary of selected patients:

- A table shows number of patients, accuracy of predictions, mean predicted diagnosis risk, number of medical codes, name of top contributing medical codes and sum of contribution scores.
- A distribution progress chart depicts:
    - Axes aligned to the final visit of patients.
    - The means and standard deviation over time as area paths along with the x axis.
    - Thickness represents variance, and the vertical spikes show the mean around each visit.
- A bar chart shows the top 9 contributors.

**Area C** shows a list of patients with high predicted risk in developing comorbidities of the chosen disease.

**Area D** shows a patient editor which allows the sorting of medical codes by the contribution score or by the code type.

**Area E** shows the details for a single patient:

- A line chart depicts the predicted risks over time.
- Glyphs are used to represent different medical codes.
- A bar chart shows the top 9 contributors.
