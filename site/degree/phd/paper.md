::: slot 1

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of information visualization systems for exploring and querying EHRs, by evaluating their techniques, designs and effectiveness in knowledge discovery. The authors intend to identify potential research directions for researchers and designers of InfoVis EHR systems.

The authors mainly evaluated 14 InfoVis EHR systems by the following criteria:

1. Data type covered
1. Multivariate support
1. Multi-Patient record support
1. User interaction support

They also briefly reviewed 32 other EHR systems.
