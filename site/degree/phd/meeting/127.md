::: slot topic

LetterVis:

- Empirical
- What's the novelty?
- Comparison with previous work in case studies: what's the advantage of LetterVis?

EHR STAR:

- Great contribution, filled in a gap

PhD:
- De facto 2nd year of your PhD, started in June in Swansea
- In annual review report, state your contribution and future work clearly
- What's the skeleton and objectives of your PhD
    - Chapter 1 - EHR STAR
    - Chapter 2 - LetterVis
    - How to connect them together as a package
    - What's your contribution to computer science and visualization
- Papers are focusing too much on what you did, missing why you did them
    - Writing is excellent, content needs more work
- Avoid doing too many things at the same time (EnsembleVis, RAMPVis), they are not sufficient to be a chapter in your thesis
- What's your next step/project?
    - How are you going to address EHR data access problem (do you have a backup plan, e.g. open access dataset)
- What's your target publication venue?
    - Top VIS conference: VIS/TVCG, EuroVis/CGF

Sense of belonging:

- Networking with other researchers, eg. Mercedes (2nd supervisor), they may have EHR data too
- Do some teaching or other work for the school
- Issac will introduce his students when the office is fully open
- Additional free training provided by UoN is available
