## CareCruiser: Exploring and visualizing plans, events, and effects interactively

<Paper>

::: slot concept

The authors introduce CareCruiser to support the exploration of effects on a patient's condition after clinical actions [^O].

CareCruiser aims to provide an enhanced visual analysis system to explore the result of each applied clinical action and identities sub-optimal treatment choices. This helps clinicians investigate and optimize their treatment plans.

Figure 1 shows an overview of CareCruiser visualizing a patient's historical oxygen saturation(tcpSO2) and carbon dioxide(PCO2) pressure values during treatment plan executions. Colors are coded to represent the deviation of the value from its initial point, only brushed sections will be highlighted in color. Details of the brushed treatment plans are shown on the top left. The lower left shows a tree graph visualizing brushed treatment plans and sub-plans in a hierarchical structure. User options to filter and search clinical actions within the brushed area are shown above the main view.

Below the main view is the plan bar, glyphs are used to represent clinical actions along the x-axis which represents time. Actions applied that are not part of the plan are laid below the plan bar.

The filtering of clinical events are inspired by LifeLine 2 [^LifeLine2] and PatternFinder [^PatternFinder].

KNAVE II [^KNAVE2] introduces filtering on different granularities of time and event alignment with absolute and relative time scales.

LiveRAC [^LiveRAC] arranges charts in a matrix and provides reordering of rows and columns and zooming in multiple levels.

The authors only find a few tools that support visualization of applied treatment plans in combination with patient data. GOT [^GOT] shows basic characteristics of the treatment plan with a focus on patient data. CareVis [^CareVis] supports temporal constraints of treatment plans. Midgaard [^Midgaard] visualizes treatment plans in a hierarchical structure.
