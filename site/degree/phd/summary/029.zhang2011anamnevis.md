## AnamneVis: a framework for the visualization of patient history and medical diagnostics chains

<Paper>

::: slot concept

Zhang et al. present AnamneVis [^O], an information visualization tool for EHR that comprehensibly organizes EHR documents via the concept of Five W’s (who, when, what, where, why, and also how).

As identified by the authors, the inefficient and fragmented display of patient information is a major cause that contributes towards the low acceptance of EHR in clinical practice, which lags far behind its expectation and potential.

::: slot implementation

AnamneVis first applies NLP for extracting structured information and relationships from EHRs, and uses International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as the medical standard for mapping diseases and symptoms.

Figure 1 shows an overview of AnamneVis, the authors use the sunburst chart as the base and encode each node with additional information. The first layer corresponds to the highest code hierarchy level. The second layer shows detailed sub-categories. The third layer contains symptoms, procedures or diagnosis. Users can interactively expand and collapse nodes for exploration.
