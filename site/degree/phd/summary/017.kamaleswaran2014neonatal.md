## Visualizing Neonatal Spells: Temporal Visual Analytics of High Frequency Cardiorespiratory Physiological Event Streams

<Paper>

::: slot concept

The authors introduce a novel visualization for neonatal spells analytics [^O] that enables clinical researchers to visually detect trends and patterns in large collections of physiological data monitored in a neonatal intensive care unit.

Neonatal clinicians are able to explore the dataset for abnormalities and react rapidly. Visualizing such a large dataset also minimizes the impact of misinformation caused by errors (in this case, medical monitor failures) [^2].

::: slot implementation

Figure 1 shows an overview of the system visualizing an infant's breathing pauses over 42 days. The x-axis represents the bin size used, which is the summed number of breathing pauses per hour. The y-axis indicates the date. Darker color indicates higher frequency.

The authors manually set the bin sizes by evaluating intervals in the dataset. The system also provides sampling and hierarchical clustering by occurrence and severity.

The algorithm for detecting and classifying neonatal spells is taken from Artemis [^Artemis][^3], an online health analytic system developed previously by the same authors .

Techniques to amplify signals from highly dense data and minimize low density areas are introduced by CloudLines [^CL] and Lampe and Hauser [^I].
